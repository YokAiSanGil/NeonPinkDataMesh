NeonPinkDataMesh,
is a real-time 3D visualization built with Three.js that brings a cyberpunk data mesh to life. 
This project creates a dynamic neon pink network of interconnected nodes that continuously change and interact, with cryptic, ever-evolving code displayed on each node.

Features
	•	Dynamic 3D Mesh:
A network of glowing nodes connected by lines that update in real time, giving the impression of a living digital structure.
	•	Cryptic Code Sprites:
Each node displays randomized, cryptic alphanumeric codes that refresh continuously, adding to the futuristic aesthetic.
	•	Interactive Exploration:
Navigate the 3D space in a spaceship-like first-person perspective using PointerLockControls and WASD keys. The controls provide true free-flight navigation where the camera moves in the direction it faces.
	•	Idle Camera Mode:
When no user input is detected for 10 seconds, the system automatically transitions to an orbital idle mode. The camera smoothly starts from its last position at zero speed and gradually accelerates into a constant, smooth orbit around the center of the mesh—offering continuously changing perspectives.
	•	Modular and Extensible:
The project is organized into separate modules for scene setup, mesh management, controls, idle camera behavior, and utilities, making it easy to maintain and extend.
